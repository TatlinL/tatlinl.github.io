Like the "Small Family" event mentioned above, this event also has multiple parts to enjoy. The first part occurs upon entering the Darilsheid pub through the front door. A rowdy Seingald soldier will try to put the moves on Rutee, but an uninterested Rutee immediately rejects him. The rest of the parts of this event have a limited duration for when you can see them, so be sure to check their availability so you don't miss any of them.

This event only appears for a short time, so it's best to complete it PRIOR TO heading to Staylize Temple. Visit the dining room in Seinegald Castle, which is located at the end of the corridor on the left side of the first floor. A child will shout "mother," leading Stahn and the party to wonder for a moment if this child is Mary's (?). In the end, it all turns out to be a misunderstanding.

Leon (?) expresses concern for her husband's safety, but leaves without telling her about the crash.
