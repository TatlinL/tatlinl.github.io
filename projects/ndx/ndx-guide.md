When you visit Euclid Village in the first part, you will meet the Wonder Chef, who will give you a recipe for onigiri (rice balls) and three sets of ingredients. After that, you will find Wonder Chefs disguised as various objects in various locations, and you will receive the recipe and ingredients. After meeting all of the Wonder Chef listed in the table below, check out the WonderChef disguised as a Goemon bath in Euclid Village and you will receive a valuable item, the [Universal Kitchen Knife]. This is a useful item that increases the effect of additional ingredients in cooking by 10%. Now it's time to start cooking again and again to master all the recipes.
